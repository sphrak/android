## Code Contribution Guidelines
If you would like to contribute code to the project fork the project and find an issue/feature you would like to work on. Ideally check with a maintainer so you dont work on something that might be in the workings already.

Your pull request will be failed by the build server if it does not have passing unittests and lintchecks. A build can also be failed if you decrease the testing coverage.

When submitting a pull request make sure you squash
the commit(s) for that PR -- Do this so we can keep a clean
git history.
